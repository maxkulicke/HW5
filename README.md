# HW5
Day Planner

a few overarching goals for this assignment:

functions:
- concentrate on small, clean and clear functions, even if it means a lot of them. shooting for nothing longer than 10-12(ish) lines
- using function returns as arguments, eliminating variable creation as much as possible
- treating each iteration as its own function (as much as possible)

front end:
- hard code as little of the front end as possible. make it super reactive on the back end, and try to make almost anything "specific" (ie, date, time, hrs, events, etc) visually generatef by the back end.

UX:
- i built the day planner i would want, or at least tried to. tried to pay attention to little detail things that would hopefully shape and direct a real user
- tried to eliminate the possibility of unexpected or unwanted behaviors/actions (adding empty list events, accidentally clearing the day and it's data) 
- tried to focus on little things that would help with an actual calendar (it should visually update without needing refresh, should change states on the hour, etc)
